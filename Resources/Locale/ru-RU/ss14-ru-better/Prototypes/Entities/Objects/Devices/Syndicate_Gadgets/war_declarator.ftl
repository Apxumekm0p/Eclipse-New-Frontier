    .desc = Use to send a declaration of hostilities to the target, delaying your shuttle departure while they prepare for your assault. Such a brazen move will attract the attention of powerful benefactors within the Syndicate, who will supply your team with a massive amount of bonus telecrystals. Must be used at start of mission, or your benefactors will lose interest.
