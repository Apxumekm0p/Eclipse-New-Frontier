ent-BaseMobArgocyteExpeditions = argocyte
    .desc = A distant relative of Xenos, Argocytes are known throughout the sector for their ability to eat and digest almost anything, from organic matter to reinforced plastitanium vault walls. Just like Xenos, this species is well-acclimated to hostile environments: neither the vacuum of space nor the extreme heat and pressure of a planet consumed by plasma fire can kill these creatures.
